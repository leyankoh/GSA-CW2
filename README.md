#GSA-CW2 

This project was undertaken as part of my undergraduate BA Geography course. Module name: Applied Spatial Analysis and Geocomputation

I used k-means clustering methods in order to try identify areas of London that might be gentrifying, following the definitions of gentrification as identified in academic articles.

The following map was then produced from all the data:

R was used to create radial plots that could then be used to tease out the characteristics of each group demographics were sorted into. 

Examples:
